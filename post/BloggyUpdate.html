              <p><b>Side Note</b><br> While writing this I'm very sleepy so let's see how many
                words I can write before giving in to sleep.</p>

              <p><b>Progress So Far</b><br> I've been experimenting with CSS Frameworks. My first attempt at using
                them ended in complete failure as it overwrote my entire styling something which I did not know was a thing.
                Well you live and learn so all in all can't complain. A second introduction was given to me a few days ago
                where a friend introduced me to bootstrap and I gotta say bootstrap is pretty nice. Why you ask and I say
                if you had seen my styling before you would not have considered this site a blog site. Boostrap allowed me
                  to give more life to my site with the assistance of my friend who showed all the wonders of the framework. Now, I must
                  explore the treasure chest that is docs of bootstrap to see its many more wonders. Short blog ik ik but I'm sleepy.
