              <p><b>Side Note</b><br>This is a precursor to another blog I'm supposed to write tomorrow. I delibrately omit dates and use only times so no one ever really knows when I actually write them. </p>

              <p><b>What is Haxe Really?</b><br> I've been reading through this language and its abilities for the last two weeks. It caught my interest. I couldn't figure what is Haxe. That puzzle swirled around in my head until I just decided screw my time I gotta find out. So here we are early in the morning and best I can describe it is.... Haxe is a programming language oops sorry Object Oriented Multi Paradigm Language. What it does is allow you to write code then translate the code you wrote into another language's source code. Mind blown right? All that research and the answer was on a wikipedia page staring me in the face but research is always good. Now I have another language I can play with. In my next blog I'm going to explain how I see programming as a whole. Wanna know if anyone shares my mindset.

            <p><b>Progress Update</b><br> Slightly working on tweaking Bloggy. As of right now I'm fixing pages and searching through boostrap for appropriate "read more" fixes. Got a few projects I've been sparingly working on so Bloggy has been taking a backseat in that time. Nevertheless I'll continue to grow it. If all goes well this blog might have some implementation based on Haxe running some time soon(lol how? idk).
