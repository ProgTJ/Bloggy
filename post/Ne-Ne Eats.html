              <p><b>Side Note</b><br>It's been a while but in actuality to you who are reading this it might have fet just like a moment or two. I got caught in some work and life for me has inda flipped on its axis but I digress.</p>

              <p><b>Ne-Ne Eats wtf?</b><div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="4486363" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.3392857142857142"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/nickyoung-questionmarks-what-excuseme-huh-gif-4486363">???? GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/nickyoung-gifs">Nickyoung GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script><br> So, yeah Ne-Ne Eats its kinda a gag site meant to see what I can do with the python frameworks. I've taken a liken into the frameworks used and it was recommended I use Flask and Django as the main guys. Pyramid is barely used as I've been told so meh meh. I digress again Ne-Ne basically is pushing me to create a project which I've been previously unable to do so now I have no choice but to complete one and Oh boy it's a doozy to learn. Good thing I know Python because spacing would have killed me dead in the water.

            <p><b>Progress Update on Bloggy</b><br>
              I haven't been working on Bloggy in a while a long while. Got sidetracked trying to learn Flask and other things (Electron:)). In terms of future plans for Bloggy I'm more than likely going to link it or attach it to my portfolio website so whenever someone views my site they can see what I'm up to at the moment. As my current objective for Bloggy its going to be upgrading my CSS because I suck at it :(. Catch you next time got some things to handle... backtracking javascript so I can understand Electron better peace. Might add a gif for this hmm.
