          <p><b>Side Note</b><br>Okay so quick update. It's still the same night of the blog
            probably about 20 minutes after. Had to make a slight adjustment
            to the site. I need to figure out how I want to manage my blogs
            as well as formatting. This will be fun yay(sarcasm).</p>

          <p><b>Episode 2 Review</b><br> Okay so episode 1 is in my first post.
          It's pretty short but that's how we role for now. Let's begin watching episode 2. Netflix resume(clap clap).</p>
          <p> From what I just saw I guess we're looking at the future of ads lol. I'll be paying to skip ads wait a minute that's reality right now. Wher's my adblocker in this reality oh the money system thing. Netflix resume(clap clap).<br> Okay is awkward stares a real thing IRL because I've never stared a woman liked that so noticeably in my years of existence. I shall take note of it
          and apply it and see the results. Ow thar elevator scene hurts me so much flashbacks to my own younger slef's actions. So quick thougts on the "Hot Shot" I'm understanding now that the bike is honest work and escape is oppurtinity hmm interesting.</p>
          <p> Okay the last 30 minutes of that episode has left
            me depressed and questionable. Goodnight my fellow readers. However, quick update too lazy to type Side Note. Currently I need to give the site more functionalities and goodies so in my next hours of free time I'll fix the blog section so users can select a specific blog javascript time (I cry). Maybe I should start adding emojis hmm nah I like it like this. Bye Bye</p>
